Pairs Trading Analysis with R and Python
This repository contains all the necessary scripts and documentation for implementing and analyzing pairs trading strategies using both R and Python. Pairs trading is a market-neutral trading strategy enabling traders to profit from virtually any market conditions: uptrend, downtrend, or sideways movement.

What is Pairs Trading?
Pairs trading is a strategy that involves trading two highly correlated financial instruments, taking a long position in one and a short position in the other when their relative pricing diverges to a certain extent. This repository explores statistical methods to identify such pairs and the right moments to enter and exit trades.

Repository Structure
R/: Scripts and applications using R, including shiny apps for interactive analysis.
Python/: Scripts and Jupyter notebooks in Python for statistical analysis and data visualization using libraries like Plotly.
docs/: Documentation on the strategies, including theoretical explanations and practical examples.
Features
Integration of R and Python: Utilize the strengths of both R and Python for comprehensive analysis.
Parallel Processing: Implementations demonstrating how to leverage parallel computing in R (doParallel) and Python (Joblib) to speed up the computation-intensive tasks.
Dynamic Visualization: Examples using Shiny and Plotly for dynamic, interactive visual representations of the trading signals.
